## Types of Functions

### 1. Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They are allowed in the select list or the HAVING clause of a SELECT statement. You can use an aggregation in combination with the GROUP BY clause to calculate the aggregation on categories of rows. Use the OVER clause to calculate the aggregation on a specific range of value. The OVER clause cannot follow the GROUPING or GROUPING_ID aggregations.

All aggregate functions are deterministic.

### 2. Analytic Functions
Analytic functions compute an aggregate value based on a group of rows. However, unlike aggregate functions, analytic functions can return multiple rows for each group. You can use analytic functions to compute moving averages, running totals, percentages, or top-N results within a group.

### 3. Bit manipulation functions
Bit manipulation functions allow you to process and store data more efficiently than with individual bits

### 4. Ranking Functions
Ranking functions return a ranking value for each row in a partition. Depending on the function that is used, some rows might receive the same value as other rows. Ranking functions are nondeterministic.

### 5. Rowset Functions
Rowset functions Return an object that can be used like table references in an SQL statement.

### 6. Scalar Functions
Operate on a single value and then return a single value. Scalar functions can be used wherever an expression is valid.

## Examples. Different clauses

Below list follows no particular order.

1. Comments: -- for one line, /* */ for blocks

2. To compare STR to INT

```sql
-- CONCAT
SELECT a.id, e.exptime, e.filetype
  FROM pfw_attempt a, image_info e
  WHERE a.reqnum=2333
  AND CONCAT('ID00', a.id)=e.image_id;
```

3. To broad view:â€¨set linesize 200

```sql
-- SET
SET linesize 250
```

4. Different schemas, databases, tables

```sql
database_name.schema_name.table_name
```

5. Sort by a column's values

```sql
-- ORDER BY
SELECT id, archive_path
  FROM pfw_attempt
  WHERE reqnum=1122
  ORDER BY submitted_time;
  -- note the submitted_time belongs to pfw_attempt table
```

6. Use of LIKE and DISTINCT. Use IN

```sql
-- LIKE
SELECT id, name
  FROM pfw_attempt
  WHERE pfw_attempt_id=113344
  AND name LIKE ('%comparis%');

-- SELECT from different tables and compare
SELECT d.filename, d.filetype
  FROM opm_table o, desfile d
  WHERE d.id = o.desfile_id
  AND o.task=111888777

-- DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT d.filename
  FROM desfile d
  WHERE d.filetype="cal_detflat"

-- IN
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
  FROM DimEmployee  
  WHERE LastName IN ('Smith', 'Godfrey', 'Johnson')
```

7. To delete a table. Delete some rows.

```sql
-- DELETE and PURGE (seems PURGE isn't needed on MS SQL)
-- Below doesn't raise an error if TABLE doesn't exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS database_name.schema.table_name;

DROP TABLE table_name;
```

```sql
-- DELETE acts on rows
DELETE Production.ProductCostHistory  
WHERE StandardCost BETWEEN 12.00 AND 14.00  
      AND EndDate IS NULL;  
```

8. Various COUNT, SUBSTR, GROUP BY

```sql
-- COUNT, SUBSTRING, GROUP BY
SELECT COUNT(a.id), SUBSTRING(a.name, 1, 10), SUBSTRING(a.field, 1, 8)
  FROM pfw_attempt a, request r
  WHERE r.pfw_attempt_id=a.id
  AND r.data_state!='BAD'
  AND r.pipeline='latest'
  GROUP BY a.name, a.field;
```

9. Nested calls

```sql
-- Nested calls
SELECT some_columns
  FROM file_archive_info
  WHERE desfile_id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM desfile
    WHERE pfw_attempt_id=11199
    AND filetype="processed_bias"
    );
```

10. Use a subquery

```sql
-- WITH works when you need a subquery
-- ROWNUM, WITH, !=
WITH sel_x as (
  SELECT pfw_attempt_id
    FROM proctag
    WHERE tag='Y5'
    AND rownum<4
  )
  SELECT arc.path, arc. filename
    FROM sel_x, archive arc
    WHERE sel_x.pfw_attempt_id=arc.pfw_attempt_id
    AND rownum<200
    AND arc.status!='OLD';
```

11. Create temporary table and INSERT values. If using MS SQL, one could use GO.

```sql
-- CREATE temporal table and immediatly populate it
-- with the results from a query, BETWEEN, GROUP BY
CREATE TABLE fco_table AS
SELECT unitname,reqnum,max(attnum) AS max_reqnum
    FROM pfw_attempt
    WHERE reqnum BETWEEN 2863 AND 2875
    GROUP BY by unitname, reqnum;

--  using the columns and VALUES vector, to make sure the order is correct
-- INSERT INTO table_name (columns) VALUES (vector)
INSERT INTO ops_proctag_def (tag, description)
    VALUES ('Y4A1_Y4E1_PRECAL', 'PRECAL (nightly) runs for Year 4, Epoch 1, for the Y4A1 Processing campaign');

-- INSERT INTO table_name (columns) {SELECT...}
INSERT INTO proctag (tag, created_date, created_by, pfw_attempt_id)
    SELECT 'Y4A1_Y4E2_SUPERCAL', SYSDATE, 'my_username', a.id
    FROM pfw_attempt a, SUPERCAL_Y4E2 x
    WHERE a.reqnum=x.reqnum
    AND a.unitname=x.unitname
    AND a.attnum=x.attnum;

-- Create a table with index, but without constraint
CREATE TABLE dbo.Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
    City varchar(255),
    Region varchar(255),
    Company varchar(255)
);
```

12. Select using wildcard underscore

```sql
-- will use regions VA, CA, NY, NC
SELECT region
  FROM All_regions
  WHERE region LIKE '_A'
  OR region LIKE 'N_';
```

13. Use JOIN. Remember

```sql
-- Why use JOIN? Is a good practice nad helps readability
-- See the below equivalent 2 examples
SELECT a.name, b.name
  FROM a, b
  WHERE a.id = b.id
  AND a.id = 1;

SELECT a.name, b.name
  FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.id = b.id
  WHERE a.id = 1;

-- Using aliases whilst joining
SELECT pv.ProductID, v.BusinessEntityID, v.Name
  FROM Purchasing.ProductVendor AS pv
  INNER JOIN Purchasing.Vendor AS v
      ON (pv.BusinessEntityID = v.BusinessEntityID)
  WHERE StandardPrice > $10
      AND Name LIKE N'F%';

-- The same result is obtained with the following
SELECT pv.ProductID, v.BusinessEntityID, v.Name
  FROM Purchasing.ProductVendor AS pv, Purchasing.Vendor AS v
  WHERE pv.BusinessEntityID=v.BusinessEntityID
      AND StandardPrice > $10
      AND Name LIKE N'F%';
```


14. Save query result to table

```sql
spool y5a1_precal.tab
select att.archive_path, att.reqnum, att.unitname, att.attnum
  from pfw_attempt att, proctag tag
  where tag.tag='Y5A1 PRECAL'
    and tag.pfw_attempt_id=att.id
    order by att.unitname, att.archive_path;
--or
select {...}; > y5a1_precal.tab
```

15. Aggregation.

```sql
/* AVG ( [ ALL | DISTINCT ] expression )  
   [ OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause ) ]
- ALL is the default, but if using DISTINCT, it only goes through unique instance of each value
- OVER divides the result of FROM in partitions
*/

SELECT AVG(VacationHours)AS 'Average vacation hours',   
    SUM(SickLeaveHours) AS 'Total sick leave hours'  
FROM HumanResources.Employee  
WHERE JobTitle LIKE 'Vice President%';  

SELECT TerritoryID, AVG(Bonus)as 'Average bonus', SUM(SalesYTD) as 'YTD sales'  
FROM Sales.SalesPerson  
GROUP BY TerritoryID;  

SELECT AVG(DISTINCT ListPrice)  
FROM Production.Product;  

-- OVER to use partitions
SELECT BusinessEntityID, TerritoryID   
   ,DATEPART(yy,ModifiedDate) AS SalesYear  
   ,CONVERT(VARCHAR(20),SalesYTD,1) AS  SalesYTD  
   ,CONVERT(VARCHAR(20),AVG(SalesYTD) OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryID   
                                            ORDER BY DATEPART(yy,ModifiedDate)   
                                           ),1) AS MovingAvg  
   ,CONVERT(VARCHAR(20),SUM(SalesYTD) OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryID   
                                            ORDER BY DATEPART(yy,ModifiedDate)   
                                            ),1) AS CumulativeTotal  
FROM Sales.SalesPerson  
WHERE TerritoryID IS NULL OR TerritoryID < 5  
ORDER BY TerritoryID,SalesYear;  
```

16. Use string UPPER and alias

```sql
-- Remember, the alias is the value to be displayed when printing the results
SELECT UPPER(last_name) + ', ' + first_name AS name
  FROM dball.Customers
  ORDER BY last_name;

SELECT pv.ProductID, v.BusinessEntityID, v.Name
  FROM Purchasing.ProductVendor AS pv
  INNER JOIN Purchasing.Vendor AS v
      ON (pv.BusinessEntityID = v.BusinessEntityID)
  WHERE StandardPrice > $10
      AND Name LIKE N'F%';
```

17. Use CAST to convert data types

```sql
-- CAST
```

18. Run SQL script

```sql
-- in MS SQL  
sqlcmd script.sql
```

19. Additionals: CURSORS, @@ROWCOUNT

20. NTEXT is Unicode, whilst TEXT is non-Unicode.

21. denormalisation

> There are three types of denormalization:
>
> * Join rows from different tables, so you don't have to use queries with JOIN.
> * Perform aggregate calculations like SUM() or COUNT() or MAX() or others, so you don't have to use queries with GROUP BY.
> * Pre-calculate expensive calculations, so you don't have to use queries with complex expressions in the select-list.

## JOIN in the MS SQL Server

INNER joins can be specified in the FROM and WHERE, whilst OUTER and CROSS can only be specified in the FROM.

```sql
FROM table1 <join_type> table2 ON (<condition>)
```

The condition (using =, >, or others) is also called the *predicate*. Note that is preferred to call the INNER JOIN in the FROM rather than using equal (=) sign in the WHERE.

When in a JOIN only columns from 1 table are SELECT-ed, that's usually a *anti semi join*. If the data types cannot be implicitly converted, one should use [CAST](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)

```sql
SELECT  CAST(10.6496 AS INT) as trunc1,
        CAST(-10.6496 AS INT) as trunc2,
        CAST(10.6496 AS NUMERIC) as round1,
        CAST(-10.6496 AS NUMERIC) as round2;
```

Note that most subqueries can be rewritten as JOINS and vice-versa. If a join is from a small set of rows, to a large indexed set of rows, then the nested loop has the lowest I/O. Basically, nested for-loops. The Query Optimiser takes the decision of which *flavour* of join to use (nested, hash, etc).

If both columns are large, a merge join is the fastest join. If size differs considerably, a hash join operation is much faster. Merge join is probably the fastest join algorithm, if no sorting is required.

Hash joins can efficiently process non-sorted, large, non-indexed inputs. Useful for intermediate results in complex queries. The hash join allows reductions in the use of denormalisation, allows vertical partitioning (*representing groups of columns from a single table in separate files or indexes*). The hash queries has build input (smaller) and probe input as ingredients (see further in doc)

> Batch mode Adaptive Joins enable the choice of a Hash Join or Nested Loops join method to be deferred until after the first input has been scanned. The Adaptive Join operator defines a threshold that is used to decide when to switch to a Nested Loops plan. A query plan can therefore dynamically switch to a better join strategy during execution without having to be recompiled.

Specific configuration of the DB, as adaptive joins can be enabled/disabled for a specific query, as in

```sql
SELECT s.CustomerID,
       s.CustomerName,
       sc.CustomerCategoryName
  FROM Sales.Customers AS s
  LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.CustomerCategories AS sc
         ON s.CustomerCategoryID = sc.CustomerCategoryID
  OPTION (USE HINT('DISABLE_BATCH_MODE_ADAPTIVE_JOINS'));
```

About NULL values: these aren't matched when doing INNER JOIN. The NULL values from a column to another can be only returned using OUTER JOIN.

### JOIN flavours

LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows of the left column, and rows on the right table are NULL padded, except for when a match is found. Inversely for RIGHT OUTER JOIN. The Venn diagram is very clear to exemplify these two.

FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both left/right tables. When no matching on the left table, it's NULL padded, whilst showing the right table values. Same for the right side.

## Design

* rows:record, columns:fields

* avoid redundant info

* divide info into subject-based tables

* provide access through joins of tables

* accommodate data processing and reporting needs

Some steps

1. what's the purpose of the DB? who will use it? how will it be used? Write it down.

1. gather all the info to be stored

1. divide into tables, turning info into columns. Avoid storing results of aggregations. Break info down to small logical parts. Major entities translate into tables, each major entity has a set of attributes (columns).

1. specify primary keys: is the column that uniquely identify each row. Must be unique and **always** have a value. Primary key values should not change.

1. setup table relationships. Add fields to tables to clarify relationships. A foreign key is another table's primary keys. Provide basis for primary keys and foreign keys. One-to-many relationships, many-to-many. Many-to-many must be broken down on an intermediate table (*junction table*) so relationships become one-to-many. Therefore, the index on this junction table must be compound of 2 columns, so it will be unique.
One-to-one relationships could be used for low-usage of certain fields.

1. refine/iterate on your design. POC. Are they redundant columns? or missing? Can you avoid many-to-many relationships? Does all columns belongs to the table?

1. apply the normalisation rules to see if your tables are structured correctly. **First normal form**: each cell (row_i, col_j) can only have 1 value, not a vector. **Second normal form**: each non-key column should be entire dependent on the primary key, not just on a pat of the key, this applies for when your primary key is more than 1 column. **Third normal form**: not only that every non-key column be dependent on the entire primary key, but that non-key columns be independent of each other. Each non-key column should depend on the primary key and only on the primary key.

1. create index and foreign keys. The foreign keys refers to other tables, but should be explicitly declared.

```sql
SalesPersonID INT NULL REFERENCES SalesPerson(SalesPersonID)
```


## LIKE, CREATE PROCEDURE, and EXEC

See [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/like-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)

## Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

  * transaction: multiple operations, over multiple objects, that must either success or fail as a whole.
